# obsidian-snippets

This is a collection of snippets for Obsidian. Currently, the supported themes are Catppuccin Latte and Mocha. The snippets are geared towards desktop use at this time, but will support mobile in the future.

There are several files for all the changes. This can be a bit unruly to manage, but offers incremental use if desired. Use them at your discretion!

Assets for the test page are missing currently
